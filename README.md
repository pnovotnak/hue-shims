# Philips Hue Shims

This is a project that allows one to extend hue bridge functionality using an external 
process to monitor and interact with the hue bridge API.

Copy `example-config.yaml` to `config.yaml` and update `uid` and `host` values 
appropriately. See the Hue API 
["getting started"](https://developers.meethue.com/develop/get-started-2/) docs for more 
details.
